## Making changes

To make changes to the project, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the project repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes, based on the project's main branch.
3. Make your changes. Ensure you've followed the coding style and standards.
4. Test your changes thoroughly, ensuring all existing tests pass and new tests cover your changes where appropriate.
5. Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.
6. Push your changes to your fork.

Once we check everything, we will merge the changes into the main branch and include it in the next release.

## Guidelines for pull requests

When submitting a pull request, please ensure that:

- Your pull request is concise and well-scoped
- Your code is properly tested
- Your code adheres to the project's coding standards and style guidelines
- Your commit message is clear and descriptive

Try to avoid creating large pull requests that include multiple unrelated changes. Instead, break them down into smaller, more focused pull requests. This will make it easier for us to review and merge your changes.
