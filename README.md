## Requirements

You need to use [Retrofit][retrofit] in your project

## Getting started

To include _Retromock_ in your project, you have to add buildscript dependencies in your project
level `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`:

**Groovy**

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

**KotlinDSL**

```kotlin
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

Then, you can include the library in your module's `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`:

**Groovy**

```groovy
implementation 'com.infinum:retromock:1.2.1'
```

**KotlinDSL**

```kotlin
implementation("com.infinum:retromock:1.2.1")
```

## Usage

#### Initialize
```java
Retromock retromock = new Retromock.Builder()
  .retrofit(retrofit)
  .build();
```

#### Create a service class
```java
Service service = retromock.create(Service.class);
```

#### Setup mocks
```java
public interface Service {

  @Mock
  @MockResponse(body = "{\"name\":\"John\", \"surname\":\"Doe\"}")
  @GET("/endpoint")
  Call<User> getUser();
}
```

#### Use the service
```java
Call<User> = service.getUser();
```

##### Load responses from streams
If you would like to load response from a stream set a default body factory that loads a response stream by a body parameter(`response.json`) in annotation.
```java
Retromock retromock = new Retromock.Builder()
  .retrofit(retrofit)
  .defaultBodyFactory(...)
  .build();
```

```java
public interface Service {

  @Mock
  @MockResponse(body = "response.json")
  @GET("/endpoint")
  Call<User> getUser();
}
```

##### Load responses from Android assets
```java
Retromock retromock = new Retromock.Builder()
  .retrofit(retrofit)
  .defaultBodyFactory(context.getAssets()::open)
  .build();
```

```java
public interface Service {

  @Mock
  @MockResponse(body = "retromock/response.json")
  @GET("/endpoint")
  Call<User> getUser();
}
```

Save a response body content in file named `retromock/response.json`.

If you use `Retromock` only in some variants you can exclude files with mock responses from final .apk with configuration similar to:
```groovy
applicationVariants.all { variant ->
  if (variant.buildType.name.contains('production')) {
    variant.mergeAssets.doLast {
      delete(fileTree(dir: variant.mergeAssets.outputDir, includes: ['**/retromock/*']))
    }
  }
}
```

Note: if you set custom default body factory and do not declare a `bodyFactory` parameter in `@MockResponse` annotation your body factory will be called with value of `body` parameter.
That also applies if you don't specificaly set a `body` - in that case `body` is empty by default.
If you wouldn't like to handle the case of empty `body` wrap your default body factory into `NonEmptyBodyFactory` class as follows:
```java
Retromock retromock = new Retromock.Builder()
  .retrofit(retrofit)
  .defaultBodyFactory(new NonEmptyBodyFactory(...))
  .build();
```

#### For more information please see [the full specification][specification].




#### ProGuard

The library does not require any ProGuard rules.

However, you might need rules for Retrofit and its dependencies.
